    <p class="bq-title">About NGO</p>
<p>  The past five decades have witnessed the difficult problems encountered in providing health care services to our poor people, the majority of who live in more than half-a-million villages and in the proliferating slums of our cities. Charitable and voluntary organisations since time immemorial have been contributing significantly towards the health care of the community.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) engaged in working towards the improvement of the social, economic, environmental and political conditions of the country. They include citizensâ€™ associations, professional societies, foundations, some universities and research centers, and networks of experts or institutions.</p>
<p>With the passage of time, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) have equipped themselves adequately and come up enthusiastically in providing services like relief to the blind, the disabled and disadvantaged and helping the government in mother and child health care, including family planning programmes.</p>
